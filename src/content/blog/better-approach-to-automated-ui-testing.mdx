> The Only Constant in Life Is Change. - Heraclitus

Recently, I‚Äôve stumbled upon a challenge in my day-to-day work as a frontend developer: it‚Äôs constantly changing UI. To be honest, that's not the first time when I encounter changing requirements, but what makes it hard this time is the need for automation.

Unfortunately, when the underlying interface changes in both content and structure, I had to rewrite a lot of tests as well. This led to some nasty bugs, and missing flows. I couldn‚Äôt iterate on the reworks quite as confidently because I knew for a fact that the changes that I introduce will lead to failing tests. After that, I couldn‚Äôt separate genuinely broken tests that indicated some bugs or tests that needed rewriting. In my opinion, this defeats the whole purpose of the testing in the first place. Furthermore, the QA team can‚Äôt reliably write automated tests for the UI, because one day the elements can be in one place but the next day, in another place.

So I set out to find a solution for this problem: how could I write my most important tests in a way that even later changes wouldn‚Äôt affect them?

And I think I‚Äôve found a possible solution.

## Example case

Let‚Äôs write a simple CRUD app and then test it. The application will consist of a single screen, and let the users see all of the music tracks in a list view with pagination. There will also be some actions available: create a new track, edit existing ones, upload some music files to them, listen to the music in a mini player, and delete tracks.

Here is how the main page looks like:

<Image
  src={mainPage}
  alt="Screenshot of main page of example 'Track Manager' application."
/>

To build this application, I‚Äôve used [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, and [TanStack Query](http://tanstack.com/query/latest) for data fetching.

I had a lot of fun writing it! You can look at the source code for the entire application [here](https://github.com/chornonoh-vova/track-manager).

There‚Äôs a lot of testing ground to cover in one blog post, so I want to focus on one particular user flow: creating a new track. I think that this flow covers a lot of blockers that I‚Äôve encountered, and would have led to many test rewrites with the old approach.

There‚Äôs the flow that I want to focus on in this blog post:

1. The user clicks the ‚ÄúCreate a new track‚Äù button
2. The modal with a form to fill out the track metadata is opened
3. The user clicks ‚ÄúSave‚Äù without filling any fields
4. Fields, that are required (such as the name of the track) show an error

Here is how modal looks like initially:

<Image src={modalInitial} alt="Screenshot of create track modal" />

Here is how modal looks like with errors:

<Image
  src={modalError}
  alt="Screenshot of create track modal with errors on the fields"
/>

## Let's write some tests

Let‚Äôs start with the first test case. We need to get the ‚ÄúCreate Track‚Äù button, click it, and make sure that the page contains the dialog with the title ‚ÄúCreate a Track‚Äù.

```ts
it("opens a create track modal", async () => {
  renderPage();

  await expect
    .element(page.getByRole("button", { name: "Create Track" }))
    .toBeInTheDocument();

  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Create Track" }).click();

  await expect
    .element(page.getByRole("dialog", { name: "Create a Track" }))
    .toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

This is a good approach to testing - we are ensuring the business logic by interacting with elements that users see. This test is using Playwright‚Äôs [getByRole](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-by-role) locator. This way, we are also ensuring the accessible roles and names for elements along the way, which is great for a11y testing. But there are a couple of problems with this approach:

- What if the text for a button changes?
- What if the text for the dialog title changes?
- What if we need to automatically test an application in a different language?
  All of these changes (and they are quite common) will lead to failing tests on the slightest change, and these tests cannot be used in automation scenarios.

Let‚Äôs move on to a second case. In this test case, we are also clicking the ‚ÄúCreate Track‚Äù button, and then immediately ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button and verifying that required fields have errors.

```ts
it("should show errors when required fields are not filled", async () => {
  renderPage();

  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Create Track" }).click();

  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Save" }).click();

  await expect
    .element(page.getByText("Track title is required"))
    .toBeInTheDocument();

  await expect
    .element(page.getByText("Track artist is required"))
    .toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Here I‚Äôve used another Playwright locator: [getByText](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-by-text). I‚Äôd argue that this locator is even more brittle than previous ones that I‚Äôve used.

Obviously, this locator has the same problems, that we discussed before, so I decided to take a step back and research a little about what can be used instead. I stumbled upon this locator in the Playwright docs: [getByTestId](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#locate-by-test-id). The [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) has a similar solution exactly for that: [getByTestId](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/bytestid).

## Refactor time

Let‚Äôs try applying idea this to our application.

Firstly, we‚Äôll need to add `data-testid` attributes to the elements that we are interested in.

1. Create track button

```tsx
<Button data-testid="create-track-button">
  <Plus />
  Create Track
</Button>
```

2. Track form

```tsx
<form
  data-testid="track-form"
  onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}
  className="space-y-8"
></form>
```

3. Save button

```tsx
<LoadingButton isLoading={isPending} data-testid="submit-button" type="submit">
  Save
</LoadingButton>
```

4. Form error messages

```tsx
<FormMessage data-testid="error-title" />
<FormMessage data-testid="error-artist" />
```

After these changes, tests for the flow can be updated like this:

```ts
it("opens a create track modal", async () => {
  renderPage();

  await expect
    .element(page.getByTestId("create-track-button"))
    .toBeInTheDocument();

  await page.getByTestId("create-track-button").click();

  await expect.element(page.getByTestId("track-form")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

it("should show errors when required fields are not filled", async () => {
  renderPage();

  await page.getByTestId("create-track-button").click();

  await page.getByTestId("submit-button").click();

  await expect.element(page.getByTestId("error-title")).toBeInTheDocument();

  await expect.element(page.getByTestId("error-artist")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

That‚Äôs looking much better! I think it solves all of the problems that I‚Äôve highlighted in the first approach:

- It doesn‚Äôt matter what the text of the buttons are. We will still reliably select those buttons (given that they weren‚Äôt removed entirely üòÖ)
- We are not depending on the dialog title anymore, we are just getting the form directly.
- We are not depending on the text of the validation errors. We are only testing that they appear after validation.
- We can even run the same set of tests in different languages! Because no matter the language, our business logic stays the same.

But this approach has some downsides as well:

- We are no longer asserting the accessible roles of the elements that we are selecting. For example, the element `create-track-button` could be anything, like div, with an `onClick` attached to it.
- We are no longer asserting what these validation errors are, they could be entirely different from what we are expecting to see.
- Both Playwright and Testing Library docs advise against using this technique. It should be our last resort, it should only be used when all other methods are not working.

## Conclusion

`data-testid` attributes are not a silver bullet to solve all of my problems with UI tests. But when used wisely, they can help solve the problem of automating a large number of user flows that need to be performed. I think that I‚Äôll be using this technique more in my work.
